## About The Project

The Manfu API project is an innovative solution designed for the bustling world of buffet restaurants, specifically focusing on hotpot establishments.
This advanced API technology streamlines the entire dining process, from ordering to kitchen management, enhancing both customer experience and operational efficiency.
It allows customers to conveniently place their orders directly through a digital interface, reducing wait times and improving order accuracy.
In the kitchen, chefs receive real-time updates, enabling them to manage food preparation more effectively.
Furthermore, the Manfu API integrates seamlessly with service staff workflows, ensuring that all aspects of the restaurant - from the kitchen to the dining floor - are synchronized for optimal performance.
